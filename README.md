# Losing The Lyrics

[https://losing-the-lyrics.herokuapp.com/](https://losing-the-lyrics.herokuapp.com/)

Losing the lyrics is a game based on the TV show Don't Forget The Lyrics and you use it like a jackbox style game.

The goal of the game is to finish singing the line in a song karaoke style after the music stops.

The branch being hosted is an outdated version. The currently worked on branch is the front-end refactor.

***Voice Recognition works using the Web Speech Api. This api is not available in safari and must be enabled on spotify. This app will not work without this!***

## How to create a game

To create a game press the host game button and authenticate with your spotify premium account. The game will then link with your spotify account to play audio through the host device.

***THE LYRICS AND AUDIO IS ONLY PLAYED THROUGH THE HOST DEVICE***

After authenticating you will see a room code that players can use to join.

When everyone is in the game you can start the game then select a playlist of pre-selected songs then the game will start playing.

_I'm currently looking for a solution to be able to use a spotify playlist from the host account but its difficulty trying to select a memorable part of a song and find lyrics to sync up with it_ 

## How to play
Once the game start the game will start showing lyrics on the host device along with music. Players will have a set amount of time to complete the phrase.

One point is awarded for partial correctness and three if you get it perfectly correct.

At the end of how ever many rounds the scores will be displayed and the winner will be declared as the karaoke overlord and better than everyone else.
